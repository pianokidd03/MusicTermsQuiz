I am currently studing grade 8 music theory and I wanted something to drill me in the music terms I was bad at. This is my second project with Java.

Program flow:

* Makes a dictionary of terms Ex: m√§ssig: moderate.
* Randomly chooses a term and prints it to the console.
* The user enters the definition and presses enter.
* Based on a basic if statement it returns a correct or inncorrect, then the definition
* Returns to step two
